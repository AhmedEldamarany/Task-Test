Simple Task to apply data passing thorugh scenes using ScriptableObjects:
SO are a useful way of passing data through scenes without saving them permentantly into the disk.
When the game closes all the data stored in it will be lost. it's only good for passing data throughout the gameplay!
Alternative may be playerPrefs, Text files, Json or XML files and storing in PersitantDataPath
after that I added a simple switch button as toggle
